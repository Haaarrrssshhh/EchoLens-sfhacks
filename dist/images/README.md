# EchoLens Extension Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files required for the extension:

- `icon-16.png` - 16x16px icon for favicon and extension listing
- `icon-32.png` - 32x32px icon for favicon and extension listing
- `icon-48.png` - 48x48px icon for extension management page
- `icon-128.png` - 128x128px icon for Chrome Web Store and installation

The icons should follow this design guideline:
- Simple, recognizable shape (loudspeaker/ear/eye icon)
- Purple primary color (#4a148c) with pink accent (#ff4081)
- Clean design with minimal details
- Consistent visual style across all sizes

For accessibility, the icon should:
- Have strong contrast

Design suggestions:
- Sound wave emanating from a stylized ear icon

- Magnifying glass over text to represent readability enhancement
