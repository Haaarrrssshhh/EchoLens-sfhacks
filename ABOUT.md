## Inspiration
The idea for Echo Lens was born from personal experience and a shared passion for inclusivity. Our inspiration comes from a close friend who, despite losing vision at a young age, went on to achieve extraordinary things, from excelling in academic competitions to securing a near-full scholarship at Stanford and even exploring creative fields like standup comedy. His journey, marked by resilience and innovation, highlighted the limitations of existing screen reading tools. We saw an opportunity to push the envelope further by developing a tool that not only reads text but also comprehensively supports images and provides multilingual summaries. This drive to enhance accessibility and user experience for both developers and general users is what fueled our hackathon entry.


## What it does
Echo Lens is a cutting-edge Chrome extension designed to bridge the gap between traditional screen readers and modern content consumption. Unlike conventional tools, Echo Lens offers:
- **Enhanced Image Support:** Extracts and reads text from images, addressing a significant gap in accessibility tools.
- **Need-to-Know Summaries:** Using advanced language processing (powered by Gemini), it condenses lengthy blogs and articles into concise, informative summaries.
- **Multilingual Capabilities:** Users can select their preferred language, allowing the summary and content to be delivered in multiple languages.
- **Streamlined User Experience:** With an intuitive interface, users can activate and customize the extension effortlessly, making it ideal for quick accessibility enhancements on desktop browsers.


## How we built it
We built Echo Lens by leveraging modern web technologies and rapid prototyping techniques. The extension integrates seamlessly with the browser, combining front-end JavaScript frameworks with back-end APIs to provide robust text extraction and summarization. Key elements of our build include:

- **Front-End Development:** Using standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to craft an intuitive user interface.
- **API Integration:** Incorporating Gemini for natural language processing to generate concise summaries and support multilingual output.
- **Image Processing:** Implementing algorithms to detect and extract text from images, extending accessibility beyond plain text.
- **Iterative Development:** Given the hackathon’s limited timeframe, our team worked in short sprints, focusing on core features first and refining the experience based on continuous feedback.


## Challenges we ran into
Throughout the hackathon, our team encountered several challenges:

- **Performance Optimization:** Balancing advanced functionalities like image processing and natural language summarization with the need for quick, responsive performance.
- **Content Diversity:** Handling a wide variety of content formats (from long articles to complex images) meant that our algorithms had to be flexible yet robust.
- **Multilingual Accuracy:** Integrating multilingual support required careful tuning of the Gemini API to ensure that summaries were accurate and contextually relevant across different languages.
- **User Interface Constraints:** Designing an interface that is both powerful and easy to use presented its own set of challenges, particularly when accommodating accessibility needs.


## What we learned
This project was an invaluable learning experience in several areas:

- **Inclusive Design:** We deepened our understanding of accessibility and the importance of creating tools that serve a diverse user base.
- **Rapid Prototyping:** Working within a hackathon setting taught us the value of iterative development, quick feedback loops, and agile methodologies.
- **API Integration:** Seamlessly combining multiple APIs (for image processing and language summarization) highlighted both the power and the challenges of working with third-party services.
- **Collaboration:** The project reinforced the importance of cross-disciplinary teamwork—merging insights from developers, designers, and accessibility experts to build a cohesive solution.


## What's next for Echo Lens
While our hackathon entry is just the beginning, the future for Echo Lens is full of potential:

- **Enhanced Language Support:** Expanding the range of supported languages and refining the quality of translations and summaries.
- **Personalized Accessibility:** Introducing user-specific settings that adapt the tool to individual accessibility needs.
- **Mobile Integration:** Exploring ways to extend the extension’s capabilities to mobile browsers and even native mobile apps.
- **Deep Learning Enhancements:** Incorporating more advanced machine learning models to further improve text extraction and contextual understanding.
- **Community Feedback:** Continuing to evolve the tool based on feedback from a broader community of users and developers, ensuring that it remains at the forefront of accessibility innovation.
